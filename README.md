GTK and Atom themes are hard to upload, so I've left them out. The themes I have used are:

[GTK-Icons](https://www.gnome-look.org/s/Gnome/p/1463720/)
[GTK-Theme](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1521400/)
[Atom Theme](https://atom.io/themes/monocolor-pink-syntax)

Colours from the termite config can be subbed into these themes to match the rice
